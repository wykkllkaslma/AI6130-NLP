The doctor asked her to review after 6 to 12 months. Recently, she discovered a lump in her left armpit which is small and can be felt only after touching. Is it anything serious? Also, please tell that does these diseases cause an increase in chances of breast cancer. She also has a fibroid in the uterus, and for that, the doctor prescribed Sevista 60 tablet twice a week, and he said that fibroadenoma would go after taking Sevista."

Based on the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), fibrocystic disease of breast and fibroid uterus, both of them are due to hormones, mainly estrogen. When using Sevista (Ormeloxifene), the fibroid in the uterus will decrease. For breast condition, BI-RAD 2 to 3 means it is was a benign (it can regress) condition (not cancer). Treatment depends on menopause. If she has not attained menopause, then she has to use Sevista. If she has attained menopause, after some time, Sevista can be stopped. With menopause, the fibroid can disappear. Fibrocyst of the breast may persist, but malignancy is very rare. At present, no need to worry. Frequent six months or yearly once monitoring with ultrasound is enough. Further treatment depends on whether she had excessive bleeding (menstruation), her calcium levels, family history of breast or other cancer.

PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol). For GERD, take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",

In case you do have any of these symptoms, including chronic headaches, a possibility of a brain tumor called a prolactinoma should be raised and excluded. A brain CT scan and MRI could be necessary under these conditions. Using metformin to lose weight to me does not look very healthy.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

    "reference_response": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today.In the first trimester of pregnancy, your ovaries produce the hormone progesterone which normally is made by the placenta once it reaches adequate size. So it is not unusual in the first trimester pregnancy to feel pain in your ovaries. In addition, as your uterus stretches, you also may experience some cramping and pulling sensations, which can be on the sides.The only thing that is concerning is if you have not had an ultrasound this pregnancy to confirm that it is normal and located in your uterus. If you already have had an ultrasound for this pregnancy it is unlikely that there could be anything harmful going on, especially if you are not bleeding.So if the pain is severe enough that you cannot function, especially if you have not yet had an ultrasound, if you cannot reach her doctor within a reasonable amount of time, you may want to pursue care in an emergency setting. If you have had a normal ultrasound earlier in this pregnancy, you really do not need to worry, as your ovaries are normally examined as part of your pregnancy ultrasound and a large cyst would've already been detected. Tylenol, or acetaminophen is safe to use for pain at the normal adult dosage during all trimesters of pregnancy and you can try to see if that helps with the pain.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown",

Dip a sterile cotton in luke warm saline water and apply over the area and keep for a few seconds..

It happens to him after playing and doing activities like sports and after school. It happens to him at least once a week and it lasts between 12 - 72 hours. Sometimes he feels clicking on front quadriceps and he feels relieved after clicking. Sometimes he says it is burning and stinging. \nSometimes he needs rest to get rid of the pain. Sometimes he cannot walk even for a day and need pain killers. I could say it is always with him. This isssue had affected his running, sports and activities. He is always the last person in all sports activities, which means he is too slow. We visited many doctors and took different x-rays and blood tests and gave many physiotherapies. But nothing has been diagnosed. I need help to know what to do and what is his problem. His health and life has been affected because of this issue and he has lost his self-confidence as he is always a loser in all games."

Now, I have two small ones on my forearm and two larger ones on my back and one on my left lower abdomen. Every time I go to the doctor and they disappear. Some of them leave flat reddish like scar for a few weeks. Currently, I am taking Ativan and Metoprolol. But, I was not on these medicines when this rash began. What shall I do now?"

I need to get a few more details about your lesions. You seem to be suffering from chronic urticaria. It may be due to many things like chemicals, dyes, exertion, insect bite, perfumes, packaged foods, dietary protein allergens and may be idiopathic. 1. Usually long-term low dose treatment is required in the form of antihistamines. Example Levocetirizine-Montelukast combination. It consists of Levocetirizine 5 mg and Montelukast 10 mg. This can be taken twice daily in the morning and evening.\n2. In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe you a short course of oral corticosteroids.\n3. Use a medicated gentle cleansing lotion on your skin for bath like Cetaphil cleansing lotion.\n4. Wear cotton clothes. Avoid allergens like pets, dust, etc. 1. If you find any causative factors such as any dietary substance, dust, exertion, etc., try to avoid it.\n2. Apply calamine lotion over affected areas.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I also get headaches, a sort of foggy brain feeling like I can't quite concentrate properly, knots in my upper traps which cause pain in my neck and sometimes down the back of my arm, and occasionally a fluttering feeling in my upper stomach.  Is this all just anxiety?  (I have been treated for generalized anxiety disorder in the past, but have not had problems with that for some time.) Or are these symptoms something to worry about?  I just had a physical and am waiting for blood test results, but my physician seemed to think there was nothing wrong.  I'm getting scared because these feelings won't go away.  Mostly, it's the palpitations that are so frightening - I'm young and don't want to die from a heart problem!  Thank you!"

        "utterance": "Dear Doctor, I observed a friend who called me for help who has a history of alcoholism since age 16 who has battled this addiction off and on for 39 years. He lost his father and went through a horrific divorce while having issues at work with his manager and started with panic attacks which he was hospitalized for around 4 years ago. He is a retired veteran with 20 plus years serving in the Air Force. He only has Tricare insurance and has been unable to get into alcohol rehab. He has never been to rehab to date. Now he is on Claritin 10 mg qd for allergies, Propranolol ER 60 mg qd for HTN and Venlofaxine ER (Effexor SR) 150 mg and 75 mg each qd for major depression despite drinking vodka heavily. I observed him today and he was coherent and interacting appropriately without slurring of words. He stepped into another room to retrieve some paperwork for possible alcohol rehab and returned and I observed him rapidly decompensate in front of me within 10 minutes to the point he was unable to converse and became incoherent staggering and tearful and fearful loosing all rationality and on the verge of paranoia. Unable to be reasoned with and verbally hostile and blaming me his best friend for messing up his life. I suspected he gulped some vodka because I found empty vodka bottles in the room where he retrieved the papers from. I have never seen anyone go from sanity to beyond intoxicated that quickly. Could the Effexor be contributing to the potentiated effect? His PCP was informed of his alcohol consumption on more than one occasion by his son and told my friend s son who accompanied him to his PCP visits. The Nurse Practitioner (NP) said that the patient s alcohol consumption it was not an issue to be concerned about relating to the Effexor and any interactions. the patient was encouraged to decrease his consumption , but I believe the anxiety is worsening therefore he is increasing his self medication (vodka consumption) which is a depressant. The NP also said she had done some sort of special mail out blood test that indicated that Effexor was the proper medication for the patient. I believe this to be hogwash. He is now missing work and risks his livelihood because he has progressively become worse since starting on the Effexor which his PCP continues to increase. Can Effexor exacerbate alcohols depressive effect and increase anxiety and contribute to a near hallucinatory condition to the point he babbles, repeats himself, talks nonsensical and acts like he is going insane? No ability to process information or interact with another person, lashing out at those closest to him? I almost called 911 today, but instead after 2 hour got him called down to wear he fell asleep. I watched him until he awoke nearly an hour later and got up and then laid back down to sleep. I called his son s who one is staying with him and another who looks in on him daily. If this happens again we, his son s and I plan to take him to the ED for an emergency assessment. Also we plan to get him under the care of a physician PCP with appropriate training, a MD or DO. Is this a reasonable plan? Thanks, RJ"

It is caled trains of PVCs. If these trains of PVCs are present, then sometimes you may have these symptoms as the blood circulation in the body is affected and the body attempts to supply the blood to the vitals organs first.A second possibility is that you may be developing peripheral neuropathy. There are many causes of this disorder. In this situation, the loss of sensory symptoms in hands and feet, usually symmetrical (classically known as glove and stocking pattern of sensory loss) is highly suggestive of neuropathy. You will need to test a Nerve Conduction Study and meet a neurologist for the same.

It is advisable first to get a reflux study done to find the grade of reflux. 2. The initial medications to be given in reflux are Zantac (Ranitidine) and Perinorm (Metoclopramide). In most cases, this works. The next step beyond this is Gaviscon (antacid) and feed thickening. 3. Also very important is to keep the child in a slightly upright position (30 degrees to ground) after feeding (and most of the time) to reduce the amount of discomfort the child may be facing due to reflux. This one method goes a long way in helping children. As the child grows bigger, the need for this reduces eventually. 4. As regards to the crying episodes during stools, if the stools are hard or if there is gas the child may cry. Both are less likely due to the enzymes. They are mostly physiological considering the clinical scenario of the child.",

In that case, I would suggest you to follow-up with your doctor who will examine you again, may suggest investigations like complete blood counts, and may prescribe an antibiotic, if necessary.3. In asthmatic patients, simple viral throat infections can also last longer, as compared to other non-asthmatic individuals. 4. For my such patients, I do not prescribe antibiotics unless patients show signs of bacterial infections like toxic look, yellow, thick expectorations, yellow/pus-like spots over pharynx, possibility of bacterial sinusitis, etc. If in doubt, I usually suggest complete blood counts, which may suggest type of infection the patient could have.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you a very good recovery and the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards.",

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever.

Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience. Child will eat properly now as he has recovered from illness.",

        "utterance": "Hello Dr. Gopi-\n    I am a 40 y/o Caucasian male.  6'-4\" and 200 lbs with a BMI of 24.5.  Resting HR of about 62 bpm, BP of 118/72.  Never smoke/drink/do drugs.  I have been a swimmer, scuba diver, and volleyball player for years.  My mother is 60 and hypertensive; my father is 58 and had a triple angioplasty at 47. Both of my parents live very stressful, sedentary lifestyles, are overweight, and have a history of poor health choices (poor diets, exercise, smoking, etc).  None of my grandparents had a history of heart problems (living into their mid-80's or later...I'm suggesting environment not genetics).\n Over the past 10 years I have had an extremely high level of anxiety (spouse blindness, lawsuits, self-employment, foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc).  About 4 years ago I began having panic attacks off and on for a span of several months.  For the past 2 years I have had palpitations in my chest that I am consciously aware of (to me, they seemed to occur around 5 times a day).  They seem worse when I feel any anxiety-especially when I consciously think about the palpitations...it is as if they scare me into having more of them.  When I was routinely exercising on the ellipticals at the YMCA, as recently as a year ago, it seemed that I had a lower number of these palpitations that I was consciously aware of.  Two FP (family practice) doctors dismissed them as a benign, transient irregular heartbeat, presumed congenital or caffeine induced.  A third doctor sent had me wear a 24-hour Holter monitor.\n    The Holter monitor showed a 5-beat V-Tach (5 beats at a .10 sec interval).  The timing seemed to correspond with the time I awoke to a brand-new alarm clock that my wife had purchased.  The new alarm literally woke me with a jump. (I can't guarantee that the times were identical, but they were notably close). The Holter monitor also showed a number of transient PVC's.  I should note that for the time I wore the monitor, I basically sat around the house or slept, as I didn't want to cause any problems with the test (and felt reasonably limited wearing the monitor and leads).  I didn't feel any real undue anxiety, but was consciously aware of 4 PVC's during the test.  (I am waiting for the report to show how many I actually had).\n    The doctor called me on a Sunday morning with the news of the V-Tach and told me to get to the ER at the U/T Medical Center asap as this was potentially life threatening.  (I had worn the Holter from 3 pm Friday to noon or so on Saturday).\n    At the ER, they took a blood sample (Troponin 0.00%), 2 chest xrays (negative), normal potassium, normal magnesium, normal T3 & T4...basically ruled out metabolic causes, infection, or other disease state.  I was on a 12-lead EKG for about 7 1/2 hours.  Although I felt somewhere around 300 (or more) PVC's, the EKG did not register a V-Tach event.  4 doctors told me I would probably need an ICD and that the V-Tachs could kill me.  The cardiologist finally came in and told me that he thought this was probably benign and wanted to run more tests as an outpatient, and promptly discharged me from the hospital.\n    2 days later, I took an echo and a treadmill stress test.  During the echo, the technician saw what she believed to be a very slight mitral valve prolapse (MVP)...the test also showed some regurgitation.  She thought both were so minor that she wasn't sure if the cardiologist would even call it MVP w/regurg.  There was no sign of myopathy-all measurements looked to be in range.  I also took the stress test.  It took 9 1/2 minutes of exercise (increasing incline and pace at 3 minute intervals) to get my BP and HR where they wanted them to be.  I stayed on the machine until 10.25 minutes had passed and the tech was satisfied.  (I felt entirely capable of going another 10 minutes, but I had already reached their target rates and I was starting to sweat a bit and breathe heavier...not Heavy, just heavier than normal breathing).  The test registered 4 couplets and a 3 beat V-Tach near the end of the test.  I should note here that my anxiety was also high during the test, as I knew fully why I was being tested and felt grave concern when I was the youngest person in the waiting room by probably 20-25 years.\n    I was placed on 25 mg of Metoprolol XR and 81 mg of children's aspirin per day.  (I should note that my cholesterol 2 1/2 yrs ago was 157, LDL was 56 and HDL was 39.  I have also used one 14-day course of OTC Prevacid for Reflux in each of the past 2 years, and drink less than 4 cups of coffee/Pepsi per week...typically I drink skim milk or water...I've had no caffeinated drinks in a week now).\n    The 1st day in the ER, I felt in excess of 300 PVC's.  The EKG alarm kept going off for the PVCs, and every time it went off, my anxiety shot up and I would have several more (I'm having a few now as I write about this!)...they were worst when I first received the phone call telling me to go right to the ER, and again when I was first told that I would probably need an ICD...The next 2 days the number of PVCs was under 100, and then for 3 days it was below 50.  Today (day 6), I would put that number at closer to 20.  I don't know if the medication is doing anything, since I am still well above the number I normally am aware of in a day, but my anxiety about this situation is pretty high.\n    The cardiologist called and wants to do an angiogram and place stents immediately if he finds any blockages.  He also wants to take all of those results and send them on to an electrophysiologist to see if I am a candidate for an ICD, RF ablation, or medicinal therapy.\n    A friend, who is an FP, thought it would be best to raise my dose of Metoprolol a bit (to 50 mg), add a low dose of Prozac to keep my anxiety down, and keep me on the aspirin as well.  He also thinks they should do a \"calcium scoring\" test and an HsCRP (High sensitivity CRP), along with a Lipomed to evaluate the liklihood of my having a blockage without doing an angiogram at this point.  His point was that he thought it better that if the other tests were negative, they should treat me with the meds for a good 4-6 months and then re-test/re-evaluate at that time before running off and doing an angiogram now.  He does think that this entire situation is probably much ado about nothing, and could potentially self-resolve with proper medicinal treatment and good diet and exercise habits.\n    The FP I am currently seeing (I just relocated to another state, 650 miles from home), as well as the cardiologist, both want me to get the angiogram and stenting as necessary.\n    I am very conflicted and frankly, scared.  I certainly want to do what is best.  There are possible complications with an angiogram.  The 10-year mortality for patients receiving a stent seems to run about 33%....a very big number in my opinion.\n    So I want to know:\n1) Do the V-Tachs I've described seem terrible? (One of my professors is an FP and he cited a study done in Philadelphia where they strapped Holter monitors on med students for 48 hrs and found that over 80% of them had a minimum of a 4 beat V-tach in that time frame.  Another FP professor suggested that if you put Holter monitors on our entire class of med students before an exam, that at least 1/3 would register V-Tachs.\n2) Can anxiety induce PVC's and V-Tachs?  \n3) Does a medicinal approach with follow up testing seem prudent at this point?\n4) Is an angiogram necessary or wise at this point?...\n5) If they do an angiogram, can I/should I insist that they do not place any stents?\n6) Can you comment on life expectency for stent recipients?\n7) Do the calcium scoring and HsCRP tests have diagnostic merit over an angiogram given my other history, signs, and symptoms?\n8) If those alternate tests look good, is it fair to skip the angiogram and move on to an electrophysiologist for EP testing and possible RF ablation?\n9) Can you comment on the efficacy of RF ablation relative to V-Tachs and PVCs?\n10) Can you comment on life expectancy if an ICD is necessary?\n11) If an ICD isn't necessary at this time, are there diagnostic criteria I need to be aware of and watching to know when I am at a level of substantially elevated risk?\n12) Is there any reasonable chance that the combination of medicinal treatment and (possibly) RF ablation may either eliminate the V-Tachs and PVCs or at least be a successful means of postponing an ICD for another 5-10 years?\n13) I saw a presentation by a researcher from UW-Madison that indicated they were having some success regrowing cardiac tissue in MI patients from stem cells that were being taken from the patient themselves.  Is this a potential future cure for V-Tachs (say, within the next 10-20 years)?\n14) Is there a chance that years of anxiety has allowed for some level of heart remodeling that makes me more suscptible to an epinephrine surge, and if so is there any chance to undo that change?\n15) I am on state-sponsored health care insurance.  Do you have any idea what \"level\" or type of ICD they would allow?  I understande there are a number of different types.  To that end, is there a brand/model you would recommend and why?\n16) If I were your patient, how would you advise me to proceed?\n Thank-you in advance for your time and consideration.  I greatly appreciate your insight as an objective expert."

Hs CRP and calcium scoring will not help you much.. if both come out to be positive you would still need an angiogram as an final answer which will add to your anxiety.. if both come as negative, you will still think why u have these palpitations and do i have any coronary artery blocks and again add to your anxiety! so going forward with an angiogram and getting an answer to whether you have  coronary artery disease is what i would go ahead with. also as i said your frequent arrhythmias can be of concern, you must undergo an EP study which can be done in the same sitting with an angiogram. a combined approach with coronary angiohram and EP study can decrease a majority of your concerns. it will give you answers whether you really need stents or ICD, or medical management. my gut feeling is you will do good with medicines.. but still we need to be sure.. please go ahead with an angiogram plus EP study. regarding your query with life expectancy with stents .. peiple with stents have a good life expectancy. stents remain patent for 10-15 years . life expectancy is euwally good with ICDs. you also need a small dose on anti anxiety medications to relieve ur anxiety..

Its an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up.You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IgE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various anti-histaminics for long duration( atleast 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non- responding cases there are many other drugs like dapsone, cyclosporine, montelukast, omalizumab etc which can be used in certain selected cases.

But I stopped straightening my hair over two years ago due to damage.\nI feel like hair products I use (like leave-in conditioners and sprays) only help my hair for a few weeks to a month, it almost seems like my hair gets used to it and adapts to fight me back. I have used hair masks like olive oil and coconut oil but not consistently. Lately, I only wash my hair once a week (it takes a lot for my hair to get oily, and I only wash it more than that if I am outside where there is a lot of dust or dirt). \nMy diet is a lot of protein and carbohydrates (I workout 5 to 6 days a week) but very little greens (I am trying to work on eating that more). When I wash my hair once a week, I also lose a lot of hair, like 2 to 3 clumps, I do not have bald spots or anything, but I do get worried about my hair. I feel overall my hair is very fine, dry, and flat. It sits flat on top of my head with no body and it bothers me very much.\nI hate when other girls complain about their hair saying it is dead and they need a haircut, when their hair is way better than mine.

Both hypertension and your anomaly have a role in it. The next important decision will be of surgery to correct the abnormal connection.

    "reference_response": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Congenital causes of low testoserone are Klinefelter syndrome, anorchia (bilateral), cryptorchidism, myotonic dystrophy, enzymatic defects in testosterone synthesis, Leydig cell aplasia, and Noonan syndrome. But these diseases are so severe that they interefere in normal reproduction process which is not the case here.

The skin becomes dark, velvety and thick in areas such as back and sides of neck, armpits, thighs, elbows and knees.Acanthosis nigricans usually appears slowly and doesn't cause any symptoms other than skin changes.It typically occurs in individuals younger than age 40, may be genetically inherited, and is associated with obesity OR endocrinopathies, such as hypothyroidism, acromegaly, polycystic ovary disease, insulin-resistant diabetes, or Cushing's disease.The majority of cases of acanthosis nigricans are associated with obesity OR are otherwise idiopathic. This is likely because of insulin resistance, and more likely to occur in darker-skinned persons. This is also known as Pseudo-Acanthosis Nigricans.Acanthosis nigricans is likely to improve in circumstances where a known cause is removed. For example, obesity-related acanthosis nigricans will improve with weight loss.People with acanthosis nigricans in general should be screened for diabetes. Weight loss and controlling blood glucose levels through exercise and diet often improves symptoms.Topical tretinoin 0.05% cream once daily at night helps to lighten pigmentation along with weight loss, exercise and diet management.Alpha-Lipoic acid ha been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and thereby reverses the pseudo-acanthosis nigricans which arises as a result of insulin resistance states e.g Obesity and diabetes.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

Emergency contraceptive pill contains high dose of progesterone and hence can cause menstrual disturbances due to altered hormone balance.

Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next menstrual cycle and this is the fertile period when an unprotected intercourse can cause conception.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

Breast feeding is a good contraceptive in itself but not foolproof. So its better if you use some other forms of contraception even while you are breast feeding. Preferably use a condom each time. If you dont want to use a condom then you can take a progesterone only pill (PoP) or you can get an intrauterine device (IUD) or even a progesterone depot injected. In all these cases there is small chance of baby receiving some progesterone except in condoms and IUDs but that has no effect on the baby. These are all prescription drugs and it will be better you visit your gynaecologist who can prescribe the method you choose.Till then the safest method is using a condom.Hope this helps.Take care.",

It is good that you have been kept on IBS-C regime but one has to be certain. I do advise in all the patients with similar history the following:Firs of all to go for al relevant investigations like that of blood, urine, stool, CT scan of the abdomen, Upper GI Endoscopy and Colonoscopy.Only after all the reports are negative that we can say this is IBS.Secondly it is always better to get a course of 5-day antibiotic, metronidazole and be supplemented for by probiotic, activated charcoal, Domperidone as you have problem of gases and burping too .I am sure this will help you a lot. Please consult a Gastroenterologist for detailed history, investigations and treatment accordingly. If the change of routine helps, the necessity of medicines is drastically reduced to almost nil.Medicines :: You need to have a prescription of a Doctor, please discuss this with a Gastroenterologist to get a prescription. I would like to know which medicines have you taken in the past and in which dosageVit A and Vit D in therapeutic doses,Multiviatamins , probiotics, anxiolytics help a lot.Remember the simple dictum in IBS : you have to undergo necessary investigations before you are labelled as a patient of IBS.

    "reference_response": "Thanks for sharing your concern in HCM forum. In the first part, the student, as you said, is not wrong in giving lignocaine injection at rear part of the jaw. The nerve that supplies all the teeth of lower jaw enters into the mandible through a hole from that area. It is called nerve block to anesthetized the whole side of the jaw. If the injection is given just beside the tooth it will not penetrate the thickness of the jaw bone to reach to the nerve for the particular tooth and that does not numb your tooth. It is generally done in child patients till 6 to 7 years of age when the jaw bone is much thinner . In the second part your suffering of pain is little unusual. Post extraction pain is generally not so severe. There are commonly three reason of sever pain after extraction of tooth. firstly there could be laceration or fracture of the tooth supporting bony part of the jaw, Secondly the area could be severely infected and lastly it turned to so called 'dry socket'. You should visit to your dentist as early as possible for diagnosis and get proper treatment. And nothing of these are 'terribly wrong' in their occurrences. Any such pain can be controlled by using analgesics. Until you visit your doctor you can start Aceclofenac 100 mg two times a day.Take this drug in full stomach or take 15 ml of any liquid antacid before this medicine if you have the problem of acidity. You can take paracetamol 1gm if you feel pain in between. Hope this will relieve your problem...get well soon.",

    "reference_response": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

Unless you have iron deficiency --diagnosed by a doctor -- iron supplements can lead to a very dangerous condition from iron overload. Hair Loss May Be a Symptom of Serious Illness A sensitive way to check total body iron stores is to measure the amount of ferritin in the blood.

As a general rule, the less ferritin in the blood, the less iron a body has stored up. people prone to develop even hereditary hair loss, if their iron levels are low, it accelerates that process. We think it's because the hair follicles grow so much, they require a lot of ironBaldness is very common occurrence in old people, but nowadays, many young people, even in their 20s, suffer from it, due to present stressful lifestyle and inadequate nutrition in the diet of peopleTry some home remedies to control hairloss -Take a balanced diet including all essential nutrients in natural form fiber ,fruit green veges , ond supplemants full of antioxidents  ginger , garlic, lemon juice ,aloe vera juice30 ML + amla juice 2 SPOONs , almonds, nuts ,  lot of water  .

It is also very contagious too. So from you it can be spread to your wife and your unborn child which is life threatening to both of them. If you are feeling better with your current medication, you can continue. You can also add nebulization with Albuterol 3to 4 times daily along with inhaler Albuterol SOS.

In the blood test report, the levels of UIBC, DHEA, estradiol, vitamin D, progesterone, phosphorus, and platelets were low from the normal level and high B12 level. In the past, my blood test has shown low RBC. Can you tell me what is going on?"
      }
    ],
    "medications": [],
    "reference_response": "Hello. Your chronic fatigue can be explained by low levels of vitamin D, low phosphorus, and low DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone). I will explain why do you have these low levels. There are many causes of vitamin D deficiency, but most common is inadequate exposure to sunlight which I think is the cause in you. Other causes of vitamin D deficiency are malabsorption of vitamin D, kidney disease (not in your case). Vitamin D is essential in the absorption of phosphorus in the intestines. So, a low vitamin D will eventually lead to low phosphorus. And both low vitamin D and low phosphorus can cause chronic fatigue. Remedies are, increase your exposure to sunlight. There is no need for vitamin supplementation at present. Your LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol is on the higher side. I advise you to take tablet Rosuvastatin 5 mg at night after dinner for one year and repeat lipid profile after one year. Also, go on a low-fat diet. Now coming to your low DHEA and low estradiol levels, DHEA levels usually decreases with increasing age so that it could be an age-related issue in your case. It can also be reduced in conditions like adrenal insufficiency, diabetes, kidney disease, but there is nothing in your reports to suggest these diseases. Low DHEA can explain for low libido and chronic fatigue, but low libido can also be due to depression and even abnormalities in prolactin levels (which has been not tested in you). Also, get one serum prolactin level tested. My advice is to increase your physical activity and decrease your calorie intake, this will help in increasing DHEA levels. There is no need for taking DHEA supplements. Low estradiol is also due to low DHEA, but that is not significant. Increased vitamin B12 levels are usually seen in liver diseases or myeloproliferative disease (diseases of the bone marrow ), but one more common cause is if you were on multivitamin tablets it might have caused increased levels. But if you were not on multivitamins, then I advise you get one bone marrow biopsy done for the evaluation or detection of myeloproliferative diseases because even low platelets are seen in these diseases.

Generally speaking, Lorazepam is a short acting drug of benzodizepine class & gets rapidly cleared from the body in around 24 hours. Hence, sometimes it becomes difficult to wean off a patient (in this case you) from lorazepam particularly when he is taking moderately high doses like 5mg. One of the main strategies employed is addition of longer acting drugs like Dizepam/Clonazepam/Chlordizepoxide of the benzodizepine class just enough to substitute for lorazepams actions & not causing distressing withdrawal symptoms. Under cover of these drugs, lorazepam is gradually stopped. In uncomplicated cases, usually 1-2 weeks time is enough to taper off lorazeapm & as aforementioned drugs are longer acting & self tapering thus lesser chances of addiction with them.

These movements can sometimes trigger muscle spasms and this in turn gives symptoms of pricking sensations.This is more commonly seen with calcium and vitamin D3 deficiencies. So in my opinion, you should first get done calcium and vitamin D3 levels and if deficiency occurs, then you will need supplements. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar",

I did not discuss it with anyone except the psychiatric team I was assigned to because I had the misfortune of discussing in detail what I would like to do to the couple who robbed me, stalked me and beat me up. For that outburst, months after the event the doctor I told this to stated he had to report me as a 5150. I was angry because I was now the bad guy, I was constantly told I had poor coping mechanisms and labeled Child Interrupted because I would not attend sessions. I was started on Seroquel 125mg and by the end of 1 year I was taking 400mg per night. I took it willingly because it made me sleep and helped with the panic attacks I often had at night. I realized after a year I was using the Seroquel for sleep and quit taking it. Within a few weeks I noticed my hands would shake uncontrollably which I thought was an escalation of the panic attacks. When I consulted with my doctor on this she was very outraged and again reiterated my unwillingness to come to terms with what had happened and fired me as a patient. I did my own research and learned I likely had Akathesia. I was put on Valium 5-10mg 3 times a day and was given Restoril for sleep. I have sensed moved to another state and the symptoms are under control with the treatment I am now on.

The reason why it is not advised to take these too drugs together is often because of the aggravated constipation that they can cause. However, because you are having diarrhea, it will be okay to take imodium to stop the frequent stools. What is the cause of this diarrhea? if it has not lasted more than 14days and the cause has been shown to be non infectious, i will discourage any use of imodium for it may rather be more harmful than helpful.

        "utterance": "I had two cavities filled on my lower left molars (18,19) 2.5 weeks ago.  Prior, I had no pain or sensitivity.  Following the procedure I had dull pain in my jaw that radiated to the lymph node behind my ear all the way to my inner ear.  The pain increased throughout the day causing a dull headache.  Treatment with a Z Pack did nothing to improve the symptoms.  I went back to have another cavity filled this past Monday and was told I had a high spot on the filling.  It was ground down, and he moved on.  2 days later and I have had no improvement in symptoms, and I still feel like my bite is off.  The dentist did not want to see me back and tried to refer me to an endodontist for \"a root canal or re-do the filling\".  I am not eligible for endo work with my insurance for another 6 months, and begged my case to my dentist's office about out of pocket costs.  My dentist agreed to see me but says I will have to go see endo anyways.  I am confused about the cause of this pain -- is it from an offset bite, is it new TMJ symptoms (never had before), or can the nerve actually be dying and in need of a root canal even without prior symptoms or sensitivity?  I am dissatisfied with my dental care and want to be prepared with questions when I go to my visit so I'm not referred for incompetent care."

As you were being treated with macrolides like clindamycin for a week and macrolides most commonly acid stable erythromycin estolate leads to hepatitis like features and that can raise AST and ALT levels. Also incidence of hepatitis like features are high in pregnant women.

No need to worry about it, as it will normalize by itself after discontinuation of drug.       I would suggest you to repeat the AST and ALT levels after a week and it will be normal mostly.

Though your mental health is quite disturbed right now, you have many reasons to be optimistic as far as your anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder is concerned. First thing being, that you were doing good on high dose Celexa (Citalopram), which means that your illness responds, once you have attained sufficient dose of a suitable drug. Secondly, currently your anxiety symptoms have reduced to some degree, but there are remaining symptoms which are because of depression (anxiety itself could be a symptom of depression to some extent). You might experience some anxiety initially when increasing the dose. For which you can take tablet Ativan (Lorazepam) when necessary.

Coming to the history 3 months back i lost my baby in my 36th week of pregnency and when doctors diagnosed they found i have lupus anti coagulant +ve (but it is lower level) and that is the reason for intrauterine fetal death. I also have severe back pain through out my pregnency before and after one week back when i did test with regards as suggested by orthopedic doctor the results are like this 1) CRP (C Reactive Protein) is +ve  2) ESR is also crossed levels 3) Uric Acid is on boader level and 4) vit D is deficient(5).   I want to plan for my next baby now because if I age more problems also will increase and when i went to gynic doctor she suggested me to take folic acid and ' aspirin tab to prevent blood clotting'. Then i said can i use nutrilite iron folic instead of folic acid then she said the herbal things some times will interact with some health conditions so she asked me to stop all herbal things. in my previous pregnency I had lupus only towards the end not from start and I have been taking \" daily multivitamin,cal mag d,iron folic, concentrated fruits and vegtabes,salmon omega 3 and protein powder\".i read in multiple articles that Alfa Alfa herbal concentrate creates lupus condition some times and even on amway web site they have mentioned 'for cal mag d they mentioned people with lupus need to check with doctor'.Other than this I never had in my life any other health problem and my stress levels are also not too high. Now my doubt is is my health concern or lupus got triggered because of too much of Alfa Alfa concentrate from herbal thing? What do I need to use to become healthier again? Do I need to continue Nutrilite stuff? Or shall I proceed what doctor suggests?"

However there are certain things one can try at home to naturally lower the potassium levels .Potassium is an important mineral which along with other minerals plays a crucial role in aiding muscular contractions and digestion. . Alteration in the normal levels of potassium can result in several complications. High potassium level  in our body can be associated with detrimental impact on the health of an individual. If you get leg cramps frequently, especially nocturnal leg cramps it could be due to an electrolyte imbalance. Low potassium levels  . It is necessary to maintain normal potassium levels in blood. Natural ways to lower potassium levels include consuming calcium food that help ...In a healthy state, the body keeps an efficient balance of all the required electrolytes, potassium is one of them .Potassium is chiefly excreted from the kidney, but due to low kidney potential, potassium built up increases in the blood which may result in elevated levels of potassium in the blood. Increase calcium intake in your diet. Various studies have shown that calcium  interferes with the natural absorption of  potassium . Increase the intake of calcium rich foods like Milk, dairy products, yogurt, and cheese. Include them regularly in your diet can help control the potassium levels in the blood.Eat a clove of garlic in the morning and one in the evening, with a glass of milk. It interferes with  potassium absorption and ultimately helps to lower potassium level in blood.Drink sufficient water. Water helps in  flushing out  toxins and excess of potassium. However for individuals suffering from kidney disorders, it is crucial to consult your physician before increasing the uptake of water. Excessive consumption of water in individuals with kidney disorders can result in strain on the kidney which can complicate matters. , .Cut the intake of tea and coffee and colas. Stop drinking alcohol. This will benefit to lower potassium in the body.Limit foods which are rich source of potassium, they include; bananas, potatoes, peas, Lima, papaya, yams, avocado etc.Eat  fruits and vegetables having low potassium such as; cucumbers, cauliflower, berries, lettuce, lemon, peaches, canned food, etc. These foods are low in potassium.Soy milk and tofu is also helpful, as it is low in potassium.Exercise regularly  ,yoga ,pranayam -deep breathing help proper blood circulation & it helps to lower the potassium level in a natural way. A brisk walk of thirty minutes daily or aerobics and other mild exercises improves overall health  strengthening immune system and also lowers the raised potassium level. These natural ways are just complementary home remedies and they are not substitute for treatment recommended by the doctor .Keep a regular follow up with your doctor when you are taking blood pressure medications and diuretics.Hope this helps you solve your query .Take care all the best  Don't hesitate to get back if have any further query",

The presence of thick phlegm indicates it is a bacterial infection. The values of hemoglobin, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and TLC (total leukocyte count) are within normal limits. Absolute eosinophil count (AEC) is slightly towards the higher side. High AEC is mostly due to the infection that you are suffering from. For these complaints, I would suggest a course of antibiotics which have good action on the respiratory system, a course of anti-inflammatory tablets, mucolytics and antihistaminics for a week. During the course of treatment please refrain from smoking, going out in dusty weather, drinking or eating spicy, cold, and oily foods. Take steam inhalation thrice a day and drink plenty of warm water. A small chance is that it could be due to asthma or allergy. For the same, you need to take a course of the above medications and see if still no respite then we can give you specific treatment for allergic bronchitis or asthma. I hope this helps. Allergy, infection, hypersensitivity. I suggest you the following measures, kindly follow those and let me know how you feel. \nCourse of Levofloxacin 500 mg one tablet per day for five days. \nChymoral Forte (Trypsin/ Chymotrypsin) tablet before food twice a day for two to three days. \nAccocontin tablets (Ambroxol hydrochloride) twice a day before food for five days. \nMontec-LC (Montelukast and Levocetirizine) in the night for five days. \nBrodil (Levosalbutamol) cough syrup 5 ml thrice a day for four days. Steam inhalation. \nAvoid smoke, dust, and cold weather. \nAvoid cold foods, drinks, and spicy foods. \nTake plenty of warm water. Do contact me if you need further support. If above measures fail we can do some investigations and check for an allergic etiology in you.",

    "reference_response": "Hello. As your BMI (body mass index) is 34, in obesity, the decreased levels of testosterone-binding protein cause a decrease in the total testosterone levels, but not the normal free level. Before we evaluate you for low testosterone, we need to confirm it by doing free testosterone levels. If free is also low, then we need to find the cause, for that, we need FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) level. So, you first get free testosterone levels done. Also, any anxiety, depression, or any psychological issues can cause loss of libido. You can visit an endocrinologist for the same. Secondly, regarding your heart rate, it is certainly not related to testosterone. But it can be related to anxiety, alcohol, and heart. There are two possibilities, one is anxiety related and secondly due to heart arrhythmia. Many individuals who drink, tend to have a weakening of the heart and atrial fibrillation, in which heart beats irregularly and fast, especially after drinks. Hope this helps you.

As the patient is suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), the use of Hydrocodone is not advisable as it causes respiratory depression in an already compromised patient, but the patient should be prescribed alternative analgesia due to the following reasons. First, it is inhuman to allow suffering due to pain. Secondly, pain itself is a cause to maintain the delirium and prevents recovery from it. Thirdly, the recovery from sepsis can be determined by clinical examination and routine blood count. I agree that Hydrocodone can mask the symptoms but there are other pain medications which is safe and can be used in patients. Even simple iv infusion of Paracetamol can be used for pain relief, and it also works as an anti-inflammatory agent. I hope this helps.",

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.If he develops severe repsiratory distress and fever not settling in 4-5 days and feeding difficulty - you need to seek medical attention please.Regards - Dr. Sumanth",

I usually ask my patients to use a moderately potent topical steroid e.g fluticasone propionate 0.05%cream, twice daily.Topical steroids usually bring about remarkable improvement in seborrheic dermatitis in about 2 weeks when they can be substituted with topical immunomodulator e.g tacrolimus Or Pimecrolimus.Topical immmunomodulators may be used as maintenance therapy in seborrheic dermatitis since it is a recurrent condition.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate prescription.Regards",

Paracetamol is usually given every 6 hours (maximum 4 times a day) and ibuprofen is usually given every 8 hours (maximum 3 times a day). These two drugs could be alternated as they do not interfere with each-other's path. Usually you should initiate with paracetamol (according to the dose recommended by your doctor) and if the fever is not dominated within the range of it's effect (within 6 hours) then you could start ibuprofen (according to the dose recommended by your doctor) as well. For example, if you start paracetamol at 1 pm and the baby gets fever again at 4 pm, then you should give ibuprofen. The next dose of paracetamol should be given at 7 pm (or 6.30 if the fever is high) and the next ibuprofen dose at 12 pm (or a little earlier, if needed), and so on.

There are many reasons behind this kind of lesions. It mostly is caused either by a deficiency of nutrients, dehydration, or a viral infection. The virus is named as herpes and it causes lesions on the lips. I know you are taking vitamins D3 and iron supplements. So, keep taking the medications until you get your levels to normal. If it is a herpes viral infection, it usually goes away on its own. No specific treatment is needed for that too. In worst case scenario, it can be cancer due to any reason. Mostly, smokers are the target of this type of serious disease. Smokeless tobacco (paan and gutkha) is also associated with cancerous lesions like this and other mouth cancers. This is prevalent in the region where you live. It is better to avoid any kind of tobacco addiction and also drinking alcohol. Hope it helps.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Last year, he suffered a brain stroke on the right side of the brain, which caused paralysis on his left side of the body. A week after that, he was diagnosed with heart blockage, which needed a bypass procedure. After treatment, he started recovering and walking with a tripod, but he still not able to gain movement of the hand. We just found out that five days before the stroke, he stopped all his medications (Aspirin, cholesterol medicine, Co-diovan, and Avodart).\nNow, he is on other medications (Tritace 5 mg, Ramipril, Plavix, Aspirin, Feromin, Avodart, Crestor, and Rabezole). He has been suffering from constant bladder bleeding and enlarged prostate, and he is not able to do any operations as his condition does not allow it. He had 20 blood transfusions so far. The doctors are recommending to stop one of the medications after one year of the stroke, which is next week, and they are suggesting to stop Aspirin or Plavix. We would like a second opinion."

I ve noticed it now for several weeks. It s kind of a long story, but I went to the doctor about two weeks ago with tightness (inflammation) in my lungs. I m an asthmatic and have been since I as three months old. Any how, my doctor gave me an corticosteroid injection and some samples of Advair to get me by until my prescription of Symbicort came in. I went about a month without it and believe it caused quite some problem. Well out of embarrasement, I did not tell him that I also had been taking an L- arginine supplement for about 2 weeks. I should have done some research first, because after the fact I learned that this amino acid can cause inflammation in the lungs. I have been taking my normal medicines theophylline 200 mg tabs twice a day, rescue inhaler Proair as needed, and Symbicort 2 puffs twice daily. I am, however still having that feeling of tightness, like a rubber band around the rib cage. Most of the feeling comes during expiration. My asthma overall is much better in my adulthood as opposed to adolescence . My last severe attach was at age 16 when I was about to be put on a ventilator, but through God s grace was spared. I ve noticed that over the last month my blood pressure has been up and down. I would like to think this is due to all the chemicals (Nitric oxide and L-arginine) in addition to being out of my corticosteroid Symbicort. Needless to say, there is not much research on these substances and their affects on the cardiovascular system. It just baffles me because prior to all of this I did not have any of these problems. My overall weight is proportional to height, I exercise and eat healthy, I do not drink or smoke. Can these factors together be what s causing my higher blood pressure? My doctor as well as I believe that since the inflammation is not caused by an infection that in time the tightness should diminish and hopefully my blood pressure will balance out."

I could not continue my life normally.\nThen I went to my endocrinologist she found that vitamin-D was low. I corrected by eating heavy dose tablets and it came back to normal.

    "reference_response": "Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. If you have a history of hypothyroidism and have not taken medicine for five years, then it is important to review your thyroid function tests again. It is possible that you have again become hypothyroid and it is essential to know your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), T3 and T4. You should also get clinically examined and if required then do a thyroid ultrasound scan. Vitamin D should be maintained at the normal level. If it has come back to normal then you should continue eating foods rich in calcium like ragi and milk. Vitamin B 12 should also be taken care of. It will help to know what is your present vitamin B 12 level. This should be in the mid-range. Sometimes it can be at the lower limit of normal and this requires supplements. It is important to know if you have any fear or anxiety concerning your health. Please eat well and also drink an adequate amount of water every day. You are in growing age and should take 2200 kcal food every day. Include eggs, fruits, and green vegetables in your diet. Please spend 30 minutes in the morning sun from 9 AM to 9.30 AM every day and this will generate vitamin D from sunlight. Continue doing yoga and stay physically fit and mentally strong. Sometimes even electrolytes and blood sugar can get low and cause such symptoms. It will help to get your serum calcium, phosphorus sodium, potassium and chloride done and also fasting and post prandial blood sugar test done. These are important to know if your low energy problem is due to low electrolytes or sugar. Getting complete blood count, hemoglobin with peripheral blood smear level is also important to know if you are having anemia. Leaving the course is not a good idea. If you have any mental anxiety and stress then please consult a psychiatrist. Hypothyroidism can cause laziness and low mood and this can be treated with medicines. I hope this helps.",

This can be due to either compression from a bulging disc or due to spondylosis problem. Get an X-ray of neck to confirm that.- Apply an analgesic ointment at your neck and apply warm compresses. This will help in relieving a muscle spasm.- Take a good analgesic. I used to prescribe pregabalin in such cases.

Every 4 months they take a blood sample to be sent off for a protein analysis, it usually takes 10 days to get the sample back. Normally I know when the sample will be taken so I take 10 days off from donating at all before and the sample always comes back fine (because I am older, 40, weight 153 and I  guess donating lowers my protein levels). I have had 2 samples come back recently with a protein of 5.9 (needs to be 6.0 or higher) and I am wondering what it is I need to be doing/and or changing to ensure that my levels are in range. Also, how is this different from the screening test they do every time I go in to donate to test my microhemocrotit? I have been out of range a couple times recently on that and was told to eat iron-rich foods. I am now including an iron supplement with my daily vitamins.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

As you have given a history that you experience smelly white vaginal discharge without redness burning or itching since more than a year, and you had treatment for trichomonas, I would suggest you have a high and low vaginal swab to confirm the diagnosis. But as per history, it seems like an imbalance between normal and abnormal bacteria of the vagina. This might be due to: It increases the risk of getting other STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, or PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). It even increases the chances of getting HIV if having contact with an infected person. If pregnant, there are more chances of preterm labor/premature delivery. At present, you are not having symptoms, but you might have pain, itching and burning in the vagina, burning during urination, itching outside the vagina and strong fish-like odor after having sex as well. I would recommend you take some precautions along with recommended treatment: Metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for seven days or Metronidazole gel 0.75 % one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally once a day for five days or Clindamycin cream 2 % one full applicator (5 g) intravaginally at bedtime for seven days.

The pain grew in intensity, and soon it was a shooting pain that started in the lower right quadrant and went to just below my belly button. The pain is intermittent, and sometimes goes away for up to an hour. The pain initially felt digestive but then began to get worse with certain movement- including moving my right leg or turning on my left side. It is more painful when pressure is applied but not necessarily on rebound. The pain started on Tuesday and grew in intensity to the point that I scheduled an urgent DR appointment on Thursday. The doctor felt that it was appendicitis- although that it was not acute appendicitis. She ordered an urgent CT scan but said they might not get me in for a few days. She told me if the pain got worse or I broke out in a fever. The pain worsened and I ended up in the ER the next day. They ran a CT scan (I believe with contrast) and it came back unremarkable. Same for an ultrasound. Blood tests came back normal except for slightly elevated lymphocytes. Urine tests were also normal. Slight fever at 99.5 (which is high for me since I usually run cold at 97.3). I went back for a follow up the next day to a different DR and he shrugged it off and maintained the tests didn t show anything and that it was probably a virus. The pain is worse today, one week later. It hurts to touch anywhere near the area. The pain is continuing to shoot through my abdomen- NSAIDS do a little but not much. They gave me tylenol 3 and that just makes me sleepy but still in pain. I ve read other similar stories and many people ended up having appendicitis but it was chronic instead of acute and didn t show up on CT scans either- it was only found and their pain resolved after surgery. Other past symptoms: - IBS like symptoms (including a couple bouts of bloody diarrhea- these were explained away by my DR at the time as being due to constipation before the diarrhea causing tears inside the intestine or colon) - GERD and possibly Bile reflux as well - rapid heart rate - a previous long period with a low grade fever (around 99.5-100.0 for approximately 1-1/2 months). - A familial history of Mitochondrial Disease on the MtDNA- I m at 75% affected cells but only show minor symptoms.

I usually prescribe amoxicillin to control the inflammation and spread of infection. Patients of record, can ask for a prescription to be called into the pharmacy. You need to be taking the correct dose and at specific time intervals. Anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen may reduce symptoms. The anti-histamine Benadryl is another anti-inflammatory medication to consider. Infections, especially for upper teeth, can affect the sinus cavity and cause drainage. Aggressive infections can create pathways threw bone for drainage. This release of fliud rather than a build up of pressure is most likely why the tooth was not really painful. The fluid is also acidic.Your tooth is necrotic and does not have a healthy nerve to react, but the spread of the infection has caused drainage. Encourage the area to drain. Rinsing with warm salt water and gently massaging the area is recommended. You must evaluate the tooth for restorability. As long as you have enough healthy tooth structure, you can have a root canal, post and replace the crown. The alternative treatment is an extraction. Your periodontal health must be evaluated as well. You must complete treatment for the source of the infection. Infections can spread into your blood system if left untreated. You have an appointment and should have a good, non life threatening, result with your attention to your abscess.Thank you for your inquiry. I am glad to answer additional questions.",

He eventually had a barium meal to see if there was something wrong with his gut.  He is now 13 and has grown out of all of this. Anyway both his baby teeth and now his adult teeth on his bottom right of his mouth have come through with very little enamel.  Is this anything to do with the vomitting or the medication?"

    "medications": [],
    "reference_response": "Hello,Enamel can be damaged by acid in the mouth. The stomach acid included in vomit with repeat episodes can easily damage the enamel on teeth. This would occur after the teeth are errupted and have been exposed to the acidic environment. This could then be the case with the baby teeth.Now you state the adult teeth have weak enamel. This could be a genetic weakness. Nutrition and medication taken while the teeth are forming will affect the quality of the tooth structure. Baby teeth can be damaged if baby sleeps with a bottle with milk products coating teeth and causing decay. Flouride can be given with children's vitamins to strengthen the formation of the tooth while developing. As adults the addition of flouride is not recommended because teeth are already formed. Instead, topical flouride can help strengthen formed tooth enamel. Too much fluoride taken as a child can have the reverse effect of weakened enamel forming. Often white spots are seen and indicate too much fluoride. The antibiotic Tetracycline is known to darken the layer under enamel and cause grey to brown banding if taken while teeth are forming. No concern with this type of discoloration when taken as an adult.The medication, Pizotifen, does not report any significant dental side affects concerning enamel. This is not available in the United States, so I am not familar with this drug for my patients. Drugs can have interactions and you can question your pediatrician with this concern. Can you tell me why as a child, this medication was recommended? Were migraine headaches determined to be the cause of his vomiting? I am glad to hear he is feeling better. Enamel is precious. Avoid an acidic diet and abrasive brushing techniques. Regular dental exams will check for enamel weakness as these areas will be more prone to decay. Rinsing with flouride may strenghten enamel. Restorative procedures maybe recommended such as bonding or crowns to replace damaged enamel. I hope my recommendations are helpful to you and I will be glad to provide additional answers if you have more concerns. Thank you for your inquiry.",

OMEPRAZOLE 20 MG before meals  prevent acidity caused by analgesics. Second possibility is simple muscular pain.

Usually Methylphenidate is a stimulant & if taken in morning; it helps to improve attention, concentration & helps improving tasks involving some sustained effort. So kindly let me know what time you are giving her concerta; shift it to morning & NO later than 2pm. Similarly sertraline in high doses (>100mg) may cause sedation in some patients & hence entire dose can be shifted to prior to bedtime or given in 2 divided doses with larger chunk of dose in evening. If there is recent dose change; wait for 8-10 days as most side effects of these 2 drugs occur in first 15 days & subside later as body adapts to these drugs. Do revert back for further help.

        "utterance": "Hello doctor,\nI am taking tablet Alprazolam 5mg (three tablets, a total of 1.5mg) at bedtime. I do not take any Alprazolam or any other benzodiazepines during the day. Also, I started taking Alprazolam about 6-8 months ago. Originally this was for a short period of insomnia due to a life situation where I was so worried about life that I could not sleep. The situation has long passed, and everything is fine now. I would like to slowly wean completely off of the Alprazolam so that. I no longer will take it. I am also being treated for bipolar depression, and I no longer feel depressed at all. But somehow, other benzodiazepines with longer half-lives such as Diazepam, Clonazepam and Clorazepate make me feel quite depressed within an hour or so of taking them. Actually pretty much any benzodiazepine besides Alprazolam makes me feel depressed. So, it seems like I have to wean off of the Alparazolam without substituting longer-acting benzodiazepines. I will go from 1.5mg to 1.25mg for a couple of weeks, then down to 1mg, then 0.75mg, etc., until I am not taking any anymore. At any rate, I am not sure if I am having interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day. I do not think I feel \"anxious,\" though I am not sure exactly what \"anxious\" means, to be honest, even though it is such a common term. I know I do not really spend much time worrying. I generally feel calm and at ease in life and about life. There is really nothing to worry about life because everything is going well for me. But perhaps I *would* be feeling more interdose withdrawal-related anxiety were it not for the antipsychotics and antidepressants I am taking. Perhaps they're ameliorating the anxiety that would have been there during the day between my evening alprazolam doses. But I have noticed lately that I am somehow a bit emotionally labile, at least when it comes to dealing with situations with my girlfriend. It is like she does something little that upsets me, something which I would ordinarily perhaps feel a bit poorly about or get a bit emotionally stirred, and ordinarily we would potentially have a conversation about it to solve this issue, or perhaps we wouldd get into a small fight or something. But lately when something happens which upsets me, it really, really upsets me. I can get easily angered or have some other odd negative emotional reactions. I wonder if this is a problem of interdose withdrawal from Alprazolam? It is possible, too, that it is just a development in my psyche, some kind of psychological problem only manifesting recently. But I wonder if it is possible, too, that I am having this experience as a withdrawal symptom between bedtime doses of Alprazolam. I can be in a perfectly good mood, or in a great mood, or in a normal mood, and one little thing happens with my girlfriend and everything is terrible all of a sudden, I feel terrible and I end up making her feel terrible. Have you heard of anything like this in terms of emotional lability/reactivity or anger or irritability something like that as a result of benzodiazepine withdrawal? Also, if I wanted to test this idea out and divide my bedtime alprazolam dose into, for example, three doses of 0.5mg each, is it possible that I experience insomnia as a nighttime withdrawal symptom? What I mean is that I only had insomnia for a short period due to some anxiety in my life, but that anxiety is over. But now, if I forget to take my 1.5mg alprazolam at nighttime, while I do no start worrying about anything, I just cannot fall asleep. And oddly, if I do start to fall asleep, I am suddenly sort of shocked/jolted back into being awake. This is not the type of insomnia I was being treated for where I just could not sleep because of worrying. I no longer worry or have much to worry about, and I think if I were not dependent on the Alprazolam, I would be sleeping just fine without it. I might be having trouble making this subtle point: It is that while I cannot sleep without my 1.5mg bedtime dose, I do no think it is due to an underlying insomnia, but rather a result of my being dependent on the Alprazolam for sleep after all these months. Is this is possible because of 6-8 months of use? And especially is the feeling of the insomnia is super different than how it was before. Before I just worried and could not sleep, but now there is no worry, I just feel awake in an odd way and cannot sleep, or if not, then I half fall asleep and suddenly startlingly awaken before I am fully asleep. So, now I am thinking of spreading my dose out, and instead of 1.5mg at night, maybe I would take 0.5mg in the morning, 0.5mg sometime later in the day, and 0.5mg before bed. If it is the case that I am experiencing insomnia as a consequence of my dependence on the drug, then would it be probable that I experience the same \"rebound insomnia\" (or whatever it is called) when I spread out the drug? That is, when I spread it out throughout the day and night, should the level of the drug in my blood be enough at nighttime that I do not experience this rebound insomnia? So that if there is some kind of insomnia at nighttime (during this experiment), it is not because of my Alprazolam dependence but rather due to an underlying insomnia? I wonder because I would not want to try this if you think it is probable that I would still have this rebound insomnia. I would only do it if the idea of it makes some sense to you. That is because I am only prescribed enough for 1.5mg per day, and the doctor is not willing to give me some extra during this period, so I have to be careful not to waste any if at all possible so that I'm not missing nights of sleep. Of course, if there's no way to know unless I try it, then I'll try it. But I would only stay away from the experiment if you think it does not make sense. So, if my brain is used to having 1.5mg at bedtime, then even if I took 0.5mg in the morning and 0.5mg in the afternoon, would I still need a whole 1.5mg at bedtime even though I already took 0.5mg morning and 0.5mg afternoon? Would my brain expect the whole amount at night because that is what it is used to, or would it accept that I already had 2/3 the dose morning and afternoon, and so the other 1/3 could be taken before bed? And finally I just want to say that I would like to try this because I am concerned that:\n1. This emotional instability is an interdose withdrawal symptom.\n2. The longer I am on the drug, the stronger the dependence gets so that it becomes more likely that I develop more severe interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day like panic attacks or something.\nIf either of these are possible, then it would seem like a good idea to spread the dose out in order to avoid these things.\nPlease explain."

    "reference_response": "Hi. Thanks for your detailed query which is self explanatory about the problem. It was lengthy but it contained only relevant thoughts necessary to express your deep rooted concern. First of all feeling nervous or anxious is common term and if you do not know what it means, I am sure you have never had that feeling. If you had that feeling you will know it throughout your life. I must inform you that common terms are difficult to define but almost everybody experiences that. What you are calling as emotional lability/unstability is normal reaction. That happens to any human over the earth. Your calmness and composure with others (except girlfriend) indicates that you are not labile and this is not rebound anxiety. It is possible that you are not satisfied with her relationship to one or another reason. Other than that with partners, having disputes is a normal phenomenon. So, stop calling it emotional lability and set a dialogue with your girlfriend about her doings which upsets you. By doing this you will be identifying the cause and rectify the problem all together. Since it is not rebound insomnia doing experimentation is not advisable. Your question is that if you take 0.5 mg in morning and afternoon what dose will you need in the evening. Since you are doing well with other drugs gradual reduction of the dose of Alprazolam is possible and it can be accomplished successfully by you.

So it might be possible that if you did not respond to one medicine your doctor keeps adding medicine to your prescription.

You can reduce inflammation with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Try warm compresses and a soft diet. Resting the jaw is the correct procedure to follow. Continue to use your night guard. Keep up with regular dental care and rinse with warm salt water to allow the gum to heal around the teeth. Your jaw should start to feel better and the sound should not continue as the inflammation allows you to return to normal function. Have your dentist check the function of the TMJ and the position of the disc that slides as the joint is in function if you still have discomfort or sounds such as a clicking.Make sure that you feel your bite is not high and that you do not contact the new fillings before other teeth. Please make sure there is not an interference when you slide your teeth together. This will continue to aggrevate your jaw. Call your dentist for an adjustment or if you are unsure about your bite, ask the dentist to check your bite.Keep your dentist informed of any changes.

Thank you for writing to usYou seem to have androgenetic alopecia.This type of hair loss mainly affects the frontal part and crown part of the scalp.Hair loss is also associated with receding anterior hair line and widening and deepening of angles of anterior hair line.The goal of medical treatment with minoxidil and finasteride is mainly arresting Or slowing down the progression of hair loss therefore the earlier the therapy is initiated the better it is.Hair transplantation is an option if your anterior hair line and the hair line above temples have receded.Hair follicles would be harvested from the back of scalp and transplanted to reconstruct the anterior hair line.Cost of hair transplant would vary from doctor to doctor and is usually calculated based upon the number of hair follicles that are required to be harvested.It might cost you anywhere between USD 850 to USD 1500 depending on the number of hair follicles that need to be transplanted.Besides hair transplant you would be required to continue with minoxidil and finasteride to prevent further progression of hair loss.I suggest that you visit either a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon in your vicinity.Your doctor will be able to visually assess the degree and pattern of hair loss and then decide on the cost of hair transplant.You can also upload images of your scalp depicting the pattern and severity of hair loss and contact one of doctors on this forum, either a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon.Regards",

I have read your query and you have mentioned everything so clearly. Now coming to the point of your query, the symptoms you are experiencing is due to middle ear infection, one thing I would still need to know that if the doctor had a look inside your ear and told there was no rupture of tympanic membrane, if not, then this can be purely middle ear infection and may take some time to subside. Other reasons can be sinusitis, wax impact, which can take longer time to recover. Although clogged ear can be annoying, here are some tips that can help alleviate the symptoms. Continue to do Valsalva maneuver, inhale steam, take OTC medicine as advised by your doctor. Do not use earplugs, earbuds, avoid any kind of water going to ears. Resting or sleeping sitting up rather than lying down can help fluid in your ear drain. This could ease pressure and pain in your middle ear. Prop yourself up in bed with a stack of pillows, or sleep in an armchair that leans back a bit. If all of the above things are helping alleviate the symptoms, then I would not worry and only give time for sinusitis to resolve. Please feel free to reach out in case of any doubt",

Do check for family history of such condition or also if you have other related conditions like vitiligo(white patches), thyroid disorder,etc.Check for similar hair loss on face and body as well.It requires long term treatment so do be regular to doctor. You can find out about steroid injections in the patch(intralesional) which have shown good and fast results. it can be combined with other treatment.Be sure to re check with a doctor regarding the improvement in few weeks, to advise regarding further treatment.You will need a multivitamin capsule like Follihair or Biotee daily.Eat a nutritous diet and get rest. avoid stress. Any other illnesses, medication, low iron, thyroid disorders etc can also cause hair fall so check if necessary.Depending on the progress you can go in for further treatments.But do keep in mind that treatment takes time, and the patches can recur elsewhere.Hope this helps you.",

If the fever or the redness in the nose is not bothering her you need not worry. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth",

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I would suggest you maintain proper personal hygiene. You should take zyrtec once daily. You should consult a dermatologist for proper examination.

It can also accumulate in liver, heart and brain etc and symptoms will be more severe.2. Instead of multiple bleeding, you can go for apheresis. It will reduce your iron and maybe necessary on a monthly basis.3. Watch your diet for iron and try to reduce it. Control iron levels within normal range. Apheresis is necessary to prevent further damage and reverse what ever is possible. Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again.",

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Does he have nose symptoms (sneezing, nose congestion, running noes)? Is he exposed to any smoke at home? Does he regurgitates/vomits foods often? Does he have any skin allergies?From your given history, I would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. Were I treating him, first of all I would review his inhaler device and technique. This is very important as if the device/technique are improper, most of the drug may not go into the lungs and therefore the treatment may not become effective.So, personally I would suggest you to get the inhaler device and the technique of using it reviewed by a pediatrician experienced with inhaler therapy.In my opinion, metered dose inhaler with spacer device with mask is the best device for a 3 year old child.2. I would agree with the drugs that your doctor has suggested. It is important to remember that Flohale and Montair are to be taken regularly and Levoline is to be taken when he has wheezing on as-and-when-needed basis. 3. If he has frequent nose symptoms, I would add a daily antihistamine like cetirizine/levocetirizine to above treatment.4. Were I treating him, I would also prescribe him vitamin C for 2-3 months. I would also suggest you to get his hemoglobin levels and if low, maintain hemoglobin around 14 g%. These two measures will help improve his immunity and reduce frequent infections.5.  Personally I would suggest him testing for allergies to air-borne allergens and food proteins. Allergy testing will help you to identify the substances causing troubles to him and also to know how to avoid them.6. In general, please try to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.7. A nutritive diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will help him in a long run.Hope above measures will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health.Thank you & Regards.",

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?"

    "reference_response": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As your query goes regarding alternative medications apart from Omeprazole and kremil syrup we can definitely change to lansoprazole which is similar to Omeprazole but slightly stronger. Dosage would be 30 mg twice a day for 7 days. There are other things that I would like to discuss. As obvious the above medications are for symptomatic relief but we need to find the root cause of the problem. Possibilities include gastritis, H pylori infection( a type of bacteria affecting stomach), ulcer in the stomach or upper part of small intestine. To rule out any of these you would need to see a Gastroenterologist who can then do an endoscopy and get a tissue sample from your stomach to check for H pylori. I know that you might be afraid of these tests but there is nothing to worry as the procedure is usually painless and done as a day care so that you don't have to stay in the hospital. Atlast maintain a healthy diet. Reduce spices and carbonated drinks in your diet. Some aerobic exercise like yoga should also help. All the best. Take care. I hope you get well very soon.",

    "reference_response": "Hello dear, Thank you for your question. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common problem that affects the life of many men. It is of crucial importance that you understand ,that not every problem with erection, is necessarily a definitive case of ED. Factors that can cause the problem you have been experiencing may include the following:1- Conditions like: Diabetes, High Blood Pressure etc. 2- Psychological circumstances like: stress, anxiety, extended use of pornographic materials  etc.3- Certain drugs: like ant-depression drugs, some anti-hypertensive drugs etc. 4- Age is another factor as ED is common among elderly people.  5- Hormonal changes: thyroid disease, low levels of testosterone etc.Psychological stress is a common cause among young males. There is a simple way to differentiate if your problems come from stress. If your morning erection is preserved (erection when waking up in the morning), there is a high probability that your problems come from psychological factors. A consult with an urologist can give a more specialised insight for the causes of your condition. He/she may ask you to run some tests and/or an ultrasound of your penis in order to establish the cause of your problem.  Some causes are perfectly treatable and you can regain your sexual health (ie if you have low levels of testosterone, substitute therapy will resolve your problem) There are many therapeutic options for the treatment of ED:1- Drugs like Viagra, Cialis,Levitra  etc that you take before you are planning to have sexual intercourse. These type of drugs are perfectly safe to use and have minor side effects like: headaches, dizziness etc which tend to abate in time. You need a consult with your doctor to find out if the are suitable for you.2- Vacuum devices that create a mechanical pressure to give you an erection. They are very easy to use but may cause some discomfort, bruises etc.3- Penile prosthesis when all the above measures are not effective in taking care of your problem. I hope this helped.Don't hesitate to contact me, if you have any further questions.All the best. Dr. Alma",

See in general, an average length of the menstrual cycle that is considered normal is 28 plus minus 7 days, so any deviation either before or after is abnormal. Coming to your present menstrual history, you got early bleeding this time. This mostly suggests some hormonal disturbance which needs to be evaluated. It could be related to your thyroid hormone or even a lifestyle related problem called PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome).  But however any structural causes like polyps or fibroids also need to be ruled out for which ultrasound is required along with an examination by your gynecologist. Based on the past history, it appears probably you must have had an entity called endometriosis or scar endometriosis (in your cesarean scar). This usually happens under the influence of the hormones that occurs in natural menstrual cycles when you are ovulating. Right now probably you did not ovulate either because of stress or due to the hormonal changes (we need to evaluate). I am suggesting a few tests that you need to take so that we can have a look into this. Meanwhile, try to work on your lifestyle changes, do regular exercises and take adequate dietary precautions (avoid fatty or sugary or high carb junk foods). All these measures will have beneficial effects on you. Try to meditate or do yoga for relaxation. I would also like to know if you had any recent weight gain or weight loss, any excess acne development or excess facial hair growth, or scalp hair loss. Also, if you have any headaches or visual changes. It would be good if you could share the details of your recent ultrasound reports, your scar tissue biopsy report if any done, and the details of your previous issue which I am suspecting it to be endometriosis to guide you on the present problem. The reports you shared show a good hemoglobin levels. So nothing to worry in that. Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis. Complete hemogram. Lipid profile. LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test), 75 g glucose tolerance test. HbA1c, serum calcium, Vitamin D & B12 levels. Serum fasting and post prandial insulin levels. Serum FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (leutinizing hormone), free testosterone, estradiol, prolactin levels, thyroid profile (T3, T4, TSH, Anti TPO) on second or third day of next menstrual period. ? Hormonal imbalance, ? PCOS, ? Polyp /fibroids to be ruled out with ultrasound. If the flow is heavy with passage of clots you can take tablet Trapic 500 mg thrice daily after food (can avoid if the flow is normal). Yoga or medication. Maintain menstrual diary. Regular exercises at least one hour daily. Lifestyle and dietary modifications. Please revert back with the necessary details through chat preferably.",

Painkillers can also raise blood pressure values. Plavix does not have any effects on blood pressure or heart rate. Anyway, the situation does not seem to be really concerning. Regarding tachycardia, I would recommend taking a betablocker. If after the cold, your blood pressure values still remain high, I would recommend increasing the doses of your anti-hypertensive drugs. Some tips would help lower blood pressure naturally: - reduce salt and caffeine intake- lose some pounds if you are overweight- perform a lot of physical activity. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Wishing good health, Dr. Iliri",

Your treatment includes topical minoxidil along with finasteride.Yes, you should continue it further because the goal of therapy is to arrest or slow down further progression.New hair that regrows with this treatment is an added advantage but response varies from individual to individual.However, if you discontinue this treatment your alopecia may continue to progress further.Hair loss in Androgentic alopecia mainly involves the frontal and crown part of the scalp and is also associated with gradual recession of the anterior hair line.There may also be thinning at the angles of the anterior hair line so that the angles become wider and deeper (thus giving rise to a V shaped anterior hair line)Family history is positive in most and but is not necessarily present in first degree family members like father, brother.Positive family history in grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces or half-siblings is also significant.Only Minoxidil and finasteride have US FDA approval for use in this type of alopecia. While Minoxidil is a non-specific hair growth promoter, oral Finasteride and is specific for androgenetic alopecia in males.Finasteride inhibits the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in hair follicles. DHT is the main culprit in this type of hair loss.Results are usually noticeable over a period of 6-12 months of regular minoxidil use and oral treatment.The results are maximal at 1-2 years of combined treatment (Oral + topical) and then may be maintained with just Oral treatment.Therefore the aim is to start treatment as early as possible and to maintain the improvement with life long treatment.Regards",

They diagnosed at the time double pneumonia, pleurisy and noted a torn tricuspid in the right atrium. Throughout most of my teen's I came down with what appeared to be flu like symptoms as well as diarrhea. Usually within a few hours to a day I was running again.  In my late teens and early twenties I was hospitalized so many times with microbacterial pneumonia's, again a dose of antibiotics and fluids, running again. Then in my 30's I started having real bad cramps in my lower stomach as well as enlarged lymphnodes in my groin area. Stools have been dark and fluid with mucous present. Wipples disease has been considered and I do believe thats on the right track. However athe biopsies were done in my small intestine with some damage to the villi, (unknown) as well as a flattened duodenum but what showed up was h-pylori that they couldn't eradicate on 4 occasions. I have had lots of episodes of bile being brought up, nausea and of course continued fatty like stools. I wake up with dislocated knee's and recently my left leg was somewhat out of socket on the outer hip/leg. My optic nerves have noted atrophy/degeneration noted and I have a spot under the right eye that has stayed with me for about a year now. Its red and flakes with white dead skin daily. My nose and cheeks often show hyper-pigmentation or seemingly fast skin growth(?) Going for the morning ritual for the last three years is excruciating to the point of crying, remember its mostly liquid coming out although a rare hard stool is the worse, almost to the point of passing out. I am treated at present with ms-contin long release, 1000mg twice daily and 10 mils per mg, 3-5 mils every 4 to 6 hours as needed of the liquid morphine. The ytried to used gabapentine but that didn't og over too well and Lyrica doesn't touch it. The liquid morphine lets me do the morning thing with very little pain and formed stools, most of the time no blood and little mucous. in 2008 I contracted MRSA which prevented the treatment for Whipples. All I know is I am exhaustedc within an hour or two of being awake but I deal with it and try to live and work normally as possible but some days are a write off. I am not depressed just bothered with it all. My doctors are giving up, that bugs me but I understand. I also receive lidocane therapy which does help but because they can pin the diagnosis they now won't treat me for Whipples because they can't confirm it. I have even offered to pay for my treatment privately if I had too, it just seems no one wants to take the time. Does anyone know where I can go to get fulfilled help, its just my life! Thank you:)"

Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0.\nIn the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing. My thrombocyte levels got higher again, unfortunately. The first time I was told that I was anemic, my thrombocyte levels were on 485, then in my second blood test (after using iron supplements correctly it decreased to 380. And yesterday, when I checked, it increased to 435 (reference is 156 to 373).\nI was also told that I have an infection in my urinary system and he gave me antibiotics. Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?"

Platelet can be high in iron deficiency anemia. It is not a matter of worry just now. You can provide your reports to guide you further. Your hemoglobin level is mildly low and you should be given a good iron-containing medication like Ferrous ascorbate (brand name Orofer that contains 100 mg elemental iron). It should be taken without break for the prescribed duration. The underlying cause for iron deficiency anemia also should be ruled out like bleeding, parasites infestation, etc. Repeat your CBC after a few days.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

I would suggest to prefer Asthalin over Ipravent if you want to use any one of them. Don't use Ipravent for more than 3 times a day and for more than 3 days. You can use Asthalin when your child has wheezing or difficulty in breathing. But if you need to use it more than 4-6 times a day, it means he may be having a serious exacerbation.I would suggest you to start Montelukast tablet daily as he is having seasonal symptoms, possibility of allergy is there. Also, avoid cold fluids & exposure to smoke/dust.Please consult pediatrician as early as possible.I hope this helps.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards.Dr Parin",

    "reference_response": "Hi. First, we need to find out what is the cause of recurrent sneezing. If you look into the physiology, sneeze is a protective reflex often in response to something irritative and offensive which the body wants to push out in order to prevent it from reaching the lungs and thereby into the circulation. Most commonly it is dust, but can be attributed to other irritative substances such as animal fur, pollens, smoke, fumes, etc. What can be done? 1. Prevention of entry of irritative substances is the key and plays a major role in preventing allergic responses. This can be effectively done by wearing an n95 mask most times even while indoors. 2. In addition, a combination of antihistaminic and steroidal spray containing Azelastine and Fluticasone two puffs two times a day does wonder. 3. Holding a sneeze inside can be lethal, as it is high pressure reflux and by holding the sneeze, reverse pressure can be created which has no where else to go but above to the cranium thereby an increase in intracranial pressure causing a vessel to rupture resulting in a stroke. This is a far possibility, but in elderly individuals, it can happen and is lethal. Secondly, an increase in intrathoracic pressure can also stimulate the vagus nerve resulting in vasovagal syncope causing a brief loss of consciousness. It is very important that these measures are followed in order to prevent any untoward incident. I hope this helps.",

Sometimes in some men, it took longer to grow a beard. You are still in your teen years. So do not worry and wait for some more years because as you will grow older, you will get more facial hair. The beard growth also depends on genetics too, so watch out your father and uncles too for their growth. Because some men get full facial hair in the late twenties. There is no food, supplement, or vitamin to increase the beard. So beware of these kinds of ads or supplements. Some people use testosterone gels or testosterone pills to increase their beard, but in the long run, these things have potential side effects. My suggestion to you is wait for some more years because you already have some facial hair and they will increase with time, so you do not have to worry. After some years, if you do not get as many hairs as you want, then you can opt-out for facial hair transplant. But do not do it so early because you are too young and you will get your beard to grow naturally after some years. I hope this helps. Failure of gonads or testes in men.

Try to exactly locate your pain whether it is coming from the joint itself or the attachment of the tendon or some other structure around the joint. An examination by an orthopaedic surgeon can help to find this out.Triceps tendinitis is one of the causes which is an irritation at the attachment of triceps tendon. This is caused by repeated heavy weight lifting which is the case when you transfer body weight frequently.To start with if the pain has lasted for long time an Xray of the elbow joint and if Xray is normal then MRI is recommended to find/rule out any structural cause. Ibuprofen, tramadol, local steroid injections and physical therapy will help keep pain under control till triceps tendinitis resolves if that's the cause as it is usually a self limiting condition.Hope this is helpful.

On the other hand, if periods are infrequent and less flow, you can treat it without medications too. In your case, your BMI (body mass index) is very low which is not healthy at all. First, you need to eat healthily. Include lots of proteins and lots of iron-rich foods in your diet. Secondly, the cause of this bleeding is a hormonal imbalance which usually gets better as you move on to your 20s. Meanwhile, you will have to take hormonal tablets regularly for at least one to two years at a go without changing the medications. I hope this helps.",

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I m not taking any medications or have any current medical problems. I take a GABA supplement regularly (almost everyday)"

I would like to explain that these supplement may cause some side effects like:–Increased Heart Rate–Rapid Breathing or Shortness of Breath–Sensation of Tingling, Itching, Tickling in the Neck, Face and Limbs–DrowsinessIn rare cases it has been shown that chronic intake of GABA supplements over a period of time (3 months or more) has been related to an increase in feelings of anxiety, probably by the tolerance of the body to the drug (it means that higher doses are needed to reach the same effect as before).So I would recommend you to consult with your attending physician and perform a complete check up (routine blood test, ECG, chest x ray, thyroid hormone levels, kidney and liver function tests, blood electrolytes), in order to exclude other possible causes of this clinical scenario. Interruption of GABA supplements and a short term therapy with anxiolytics like alprazolam may be helpful. Hope to have been of help!Greetings! Dr. Iliri",

So...don't worry about all this & stay relaxed.Avoid stress...practice meditation..this helps in improving concentration & builds up the confidence level.Avoid smoking & alcohol.Despite these measures, if you experience difficulty, it will be better to rule out other causes like high blood pressure, blood sugar and other local causes that impair blood flow to the genital organ.One more thing...avoid consuming any over the counter medication which claim to increase the size of penis or improve performance...it may be harmful.Wishing you a Healthy Life.Take care.",

You got hit five days back, and you have still problem in every activity. It suggests that you are having a severe back muscle spasm, which requires oral muscle relaxants like tablets containing Chlorzoxazone  250 mg or central muscle relaxants, along with analgesics. Only analgesics would not be sufficient.Also you need rest as work like sitting for long or standing for long may increase the pain further. I would also like to suggest to go for Ultrasound (lower abdomen) to see whether there is any impact of hit on underlying organs. Many times small bruise over organs heal by own, and may not require any treatment , but It will give you sufficient time to take action if needed. Hope it may help you!\n Regards.",

Clive Spiegel Psychiatrist greetings, I have to discuss the case of my daughter who is now 25 years old is elder among all. her name is X. she Is not like a complete normal child. I have three other children, 1 son and 2 more daughters who all are very intelligent and good. X is very aggressive, left studies, don't care about her personal hygiene, don't know how to react and how to be like in a gathering, she shouts and gets angry over pity nothing. she is hormonally ok and C.T scan was also normal we had her checkups with psychiatrists but each time condition gets worsened. she talks to herself in her room or even in public, she is too fat also. doesn't care about herself. fights with her siblings and also with me a lot even pinches and hurt us all and my other children. she has developed a habit of collecting things from a needle to even a food items, after having her own she even takes other's things she has habit of stealing and hiding things. shouts a lot and sometimes love isolation but sometimes wish to sit with all but when she does so she keeps on murmuring in public.well there is little background behind all this, as my husband is a great Father and husband but initially and even now we always had clashes regarding our relatives and in-laws. before her birth while I was expecting her I was under extreme stressful conditions. I had a forceps delivery of her which seemed to be normal. it took her some minutes to breathe for first time. until she was 5 years old she was or seemed to be all normal but suddenly I started I realized she was a little different from other children of her  age. her father is very short tempered and she was also a victim to it. her father don't allowed me to have regular terms with my family so in this way our  social circle got reduced. she loved to visit her relatives of both side mine and my husband but only my husband relatives used to came and stay with us and eventually her performance in school got poor and she failed in 2nd grade. I used to respect and serve my in-laws a lot but everytime there was something which my husband took as a cause of fight with me after his relatives are gone. my first baby i.e. X is witness of our many fights while with birth of my other children time changed and my husband's temper improved. I don't mean to say he is bad person as I said he loves his children a lot and is extra-ordinary caring but is too aggressive as well but reacts un relevantly in situations when there is no need of scold in way that he does but he do and sometimes he need to scold but doesn't. he loves me too but don't likes my family and the case is my children loves my family and this is always cause of conflict in our home. he don't allow much to weddings and parties of my family although my children wishes to and my daughter X also wished to and now the situation is she is a little clever in a way that she know in front of whom she can react like differently and in front of whom she have to react in normal manner. as in our home her father is the only person she fears of and when he asks her not to shout etc she obeys him but reacts oppositely to me and my children. because of her we all are very disturbed. my two children are medical students and one is engineer student. we kept on getting her chekups but we have got no visible results. on the advice of a psychiatrist we had given X Aripiprazole but this drug made her a bit slow and sleepy although her mood developed and her habit of collecting things was also removed but then as she became too slow we left the drug after consulting the same doctor. we don't know what to do now as she is too old now marriage seems an impossible for her and I am worried what will she do or what will happen to her after us. I saw you here so with a hope of betterment I am writti ng this to you. please reply soon."

You can get a reticulocyte count done two weeks after starting iron therapy to check for response.2. Also improve on your diet by taking iron rich food.3. Joint pains is probably related to lupus as lupus affects multiple organ systems. You need to take analgesics and antiinflammatory agents till the symptoms subside.4.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician and performing some tests: -a chest X ray study- a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound- cardiac enzymes- complete blood count for anemia- PCR and ESR for inflammation. A cardiac stress test would be needed in order to investigate for coronary artery disease. I would also recommend trying an antiacid or omeprazole. If it helps improve your situation, it would be indicative of gastritis or gastro-esophageal reflux. In such case a fibrogastroscopy would be needed. Hope to have been helpful!Wishing good health, Dr. Iliri",

My wife always complains and we argue because during day time I have no desires and it is very hard to have an erection and this makes more friction between us. Sometimes we take a month to have intercourse. We have been together for almost 22 years. The problem of erection during sleep time started with fewer times and now it is getting worse sometimes six times during a night. I really need some help to have a calm night. What do you suggest?\nI am currently taking medications for diabetes and high blood pressure along with Insulin and Baby Aspirin."

Also search on the internet for Kegel's exercises and do them daily. It will help strengthen the muscles at the base of the penis and help with good erections. Also, start a good multivitamin with a lot of B-complex group of vitamins. Finally, for a few times, you can try taking Sildenafil or Tadalafil to help with getting erections. For sleeping, you should try taking something harmless initially like Melatonin supplements, or you can try to take something which will give you sleep and also help with your stress such as Mirtazapine 7.5 or Vilazodone 20 mg which do not have any sexual side effects.",

As I got older, I became more and more sociable, now I have got friends, I am getting along with everyone at work and I am feeling quite good about myself. I have never been depressed and I am a really happy person.

I blush like I have done some dumb thing and it is intense and very very red, anyone can notice it. I have tried to manage it by going out as much as possible and I have learned that when I get comfortable with someone, the blush and red face thing disappears (but it took two years to get comfortable with my boss for example). I am aware the problem might be associated with anxiety, but I have never taken pills for it. I just want the blushing to go away, as that will make me less awkward and better in general.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours.

But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

Montelukast has been prescribed for patients for prolonged periods extending up to even two years without any problems. It uses has shown reduced requirements of admission and improving the quality of life in patients suffering from hyperreactive airway disease. However, it would be good if we can omit the LC (Levocetirizine) content by just giving Montelukast alone in the form of tablet Montair 4 mg daily at 8 pm instead of Montair LC syrup (Levocetirizine, Montelukast). The Levocetirizine component may cause dry mouth, sleepiness consequent irritable behavior in very few children if given for prolonged periods. The tablet (Montair) can be crushed in a small cup of water, and the child can consume the paste or solution. Most of such cases usually get alright as age advances with complete remission by the age of six to eight years. Very rarely this may persist till 10 years.

You are having pain in the right jaw which seems unrelated to the heart problem you had in the past. The pain you are suffering from may be related to the throat or jaw. If you are having pain while swallowing, then pain may be throat related and you should consult an ENT specialist. Alternatively, you might be having tooth infection or infection in the oral cavity which may cause swollen lymph node under jaw and jaw pain. It could also be a muscular pain. To reach a specific diagnosis, you should see a dentist for physical examination of the oral cavity and treatment of the cause.By the time you visit a doctor, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac DT 10 mg up to three times a day. Please do not do heat application to the area or salt water gargles as if it is related with infection, it may worsen.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Although unwanted 72 contains Levonorgestrel, a progesterone which prevents conception and can cause withdrawal bleeding,  it will not protect you from the subsequent exposure you had. Since the second exposure was too close to your periods date, and happened after you took the pill, unwanted 72 may not have been effective. \n The withdrawal bleeding should have come within 5 to 7 days. Since the pill contains high level of hormone it may have disrupted the menstrual cycle and may have caused the delay. But still in your case, the chances of pill failure is more and so you have to rule out pregnancy through urine and blood tests.\n If your pregnancy tests are negative, then visit your treating Dr and follow a regular method of contraception suggested by your Dr and avoid using ECP frequently as it may completely disrupt your menstrual cycle. \n I hope this is helpful to you.",

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Is this the first time that you have irregular cycles?How long have you been married?Regestrone contains progesterone hormone. It is used to induce periods. it does not help you in conception. It is important that you and your husband should consult gynecologist and  get some basic subfertility investigations done to find out if there is any other cause for delay in getting pregnant ( hormone tests and fallopian tube patency test for you and semen analysis for your husband).If it is found that PCOD with irregular ovulation is the only cause for delay in periods and if you are obese then it is extremely important that you reduce weight. Reducing weight by 5-10% can itself regularize ovulation and increase chances of pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you and start metformin + clomid to induce ovulation. These medications are used for six months.  Your chances of getting pregnant are about 40% and having live baby is around 27%.If you don't get pregnant with this treatment your doctor will discuss with you use of gonadotrophins (hormone) or ovarian drilling (surgery)   to induce ovulation.take one tablet of folic acid dailyTo increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking ( if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week.If you have any further concerns do contact me through Healthcare Magic.",

Well, depending on the kind of operation, there are differences in atrial fibrillation percentages accompanying the perioperative period. One thing is for sure, atrial fibrillation or flutter is the most common arrhythmia found in perioperative stage, and always expected to happen. It usually self-converts to normal sinus rhythm, by controlling the heart rate with digoxin, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, and by eliminating the electrolyte disturbances, especially potassium disturbances. If the situation persists more than 24 hours, then medical, pharmacological or electric shock measures should be undertaken to restore the normal sinus rhythm. Fluid in lungs is also a known complication of perioperative period and is dedicated to anaesthesia. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care and I wish you a good health.

Stop the use and evaluate. Take some anti-inflammatory medication such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

Avoid acidic foods and liquids. Alcohol use can cause dehydration. Drink plenty of water.  Oral yeast infections can occur if you have recently taken an antibiotic or another medication that causes an imbalance in your natural bacteria. Lichen planus is an oral condition, often origin unknown, that can cause some of the symptoms described. Prescription antibiotics or comfort rinses could be recommended by your dentist.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available.

    "reference_response": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

The best possible cure is avoidance of the  allergen, dust in your case.            Apart from avoidance there is one more modality of treatment called Allergen Desensitization. In this condition first you will be tested for what dust you are allergic and once that is found you will be injected small but incremental quantities of dust over a period of 6 months . But this procedure is used only is serious cases.     Multivitamins will not help. Take more of Pomergrate , ginger and black pepper.

You continue Rasagandhi mezhugu for next six months. To increase Hemoglobin take tablet Haemwin two tablets in the morning, post lunch and dinner.

I have muscle spasms in my cheeks due to Paroxetine. How long will it last?\n\nDialogue\nPatient:\nWhen I started paroxetine(paxil) 20 mg for GAD, I had three side effects, two of which were common, difficulty sleeping and a lack of appetite. The two were manageable. As for the third, which was a mild muscle spasms in my cheeks. Feeling like muscle cheeks are sometimes tight then relaxes.\nThis side effect lasted 4 years then disappeared. I think when I started exercising it helped disappearing that. Last year, as per my dr instructions I switched to paroxetine cr 25mg cause the paroxetine 20 mg was out of stock. For 3 months everything was perfect, after which I started to take my pill at night.\nBy end of the month, suddenly I started feeling as if the medicine had went out of my body and taking it again. The old side effects of the cheeks muscles spasm are back stronger, adding to it the neck( back and front) muscle contractions non stop and stiffness sometimes due to the continuous contractions.\nNext month, only cheek spasms(continuous)disappeared completely.\nThroughout this period, the muscle spasms/contractions(continuous)were covering all the back and front neck muscles at the same time.\nSince 3 months ago, I began to feel the muscles of the back neck muscles getting smooth and slight improvement in the contractions. They are getting mild and slow. Also feeling like cracking sound in my back neck muscles maybe due to stifness. Moreover, the spasms in the muscles is now getting isolated. Sometimes back sometimes front neck not anymore all area at the same time.\nI would like to clarify to you that there are no defects or abnormal movements such as tics or jerking movements in my neck. Muscle spasms or contractions are not visual. Only me who can feel them.\nThings are improving slowly. It is annoying but I don't want to change meds cause I had very disaster experience with the previous ones. From your experience, how long will those spasms lasts?in case I don't want to change meds, what to do to reduce more and more ?any meds or supplements could be taken with the seroxat?\nDoctor:",

There is nothing to worry about if this problem doesn't get repeating itself.Heart burn is not usually related to heart problem , Your problem seems to be caused by Stomach/gut upset, it needs life style modification before any medication , here is what you need to do.1) Avoid coffee, caffeine, Fizzy drinks , junk food, smoking, alcohol (What ever is relevant).2) Take small multiple meals instead of few larger ones.3) Drink much fluids.4) Use fruits and vegetables more than meat.5) Use fiber diet like fruits vegetables whole grain bread and fiber supplements if needed.6) Stay physically active.7) If you are over weight reduce it.8) After trying out all these measure you can use syrup gaviscon thrice a day this will keep a check at your gut PH.9)  I also recommend similar patients  to use Omeprazole 40mg once a day to check stomach acid levels.I hope this answered your question, If you have more queries I am happy to answer you.Regards.Dr.Muhammad Ahmad",

These tablets reduce the insulin resistance. Harmoni F Tablet contains Cyproterone, Ethinylestradiol, and Folic Acid as active ingredients. They may be useful in controlling the raised levels of male sex homones in PCOS. Also they will help in building up the uterine lining. However, these pills will have to be down regulated before you undergo IUI. If you are releasing eggs (ovulation) regularly, and if the tubes are patent, you can conceive by a procedure called as Intrauterine Sperm Instillation (IUI). Monitor your ovulation by ultrasonography. On the day of ovulation, your husband's collected and processed sperms can be instilled in your uterus. This can make you pregnant. I hope this helps you.

In ECG, there is RBBB (right bundle branch block), and ECHO shows RWMA (regional wall motion abnormality) and mild LV systolic dysfunction. There is a mild cardiac dysfunction, so you should undergo coronary angiography rather than CT as there is evidence of blockages on echo. We must address those blockages to prevent further decline in heart function. Your medicines are fine, but it would be better if you can request your doctor to add beta-blockers like Metoprolol to improve the heart function. Also, your sugars are entirely uncontrolled, which has played an important role in causing these blockages. So, sugars should be well controlled. Continue to have daily walking or brisk walking. Low calorie and a low oily fatty diet. Also, you should start regular medicines like Aspirin and Statins and have it without default. So overall, it is better to go for coronary angiography. If you do not want to undergo any significant angiography then alternatively you may have CT coronary angiography which if shows abnormalities then finally will need coronary angiography.

Urinary tract infections are commonly diagnosed by symptoms (high grade fever, increased frequency of urination, burning during urination, pain in the loin or lower abdomen etc.). Urine for routine examination can be used for diagnosis, which reveals increased pus cells or sometimes red blood cells. However, urine culture may not be positive always. This occurs when the individual has already been exposed to an antibiotic before the culture sample was collected. Responding to antibiotics may not always be a criteria for this and resistant strains are very common.Blood investigations have probably been advised to check the infection parameters or maybe for blood culture.In the meantime I would advise her to drink plenty of fluids and maintain personal hygiene. Urinary alkaliniser may help. Acetaminophen may be taken for fever (but not >3gm per day). Since she has anemia (deficiency of blood) she can take oral iron and folic acid supplementation.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

But one thing is that there is nothing I found like ovarian tumor or something like that in USG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I have seen all the reports except first which is not loading. Because menses normally ceases at around 40 to 45 years of age or sometime it may extent up to 48 to 50 years of age. So if your mother is menstruating up till 52 years of age with USG suggestive of fibroid uterus with adenomyotic changes, your mother must have remove her uterus and send for examination that whether there is carcinoma or not. And if not then nothing to worry. And if positive then may need another operation or chemotherapy. In your mother's case if carcinoma is there, there is more chance that it would be endometrial carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of uterine muscles. I do not know how there is a doubt about ovarian carcinoma. And if there is chance or good reason for suspecting than than your mother must have to do CT scan of abdo pelvis and some other blood test also. Rest of the test which are done is prerequisite for operation. Mostly they will remove ovaries also along with the operation at the same time. Because there is a chance of ovarian carcinoma in future. And during past life and at 52 years of age there is also no role of ovaries remain. Before operation your sugar level and blood pressure should be under control so what they are giving you. And physician fitness and/or anesthetic fitness will required before operation. So better to get it done as early as possible. It is because if there is endometrial carcinoma also than why to give it a chance to grow. It is better that you remove it on first place.",

    "reference_response": "Hi there, After going through your question, I am of the opinion that:1)The tablet Fertilise f was clomiphene citrate. This tablet helped in recruiting more follicles and increasing the chances of ovulation.2) Inj. HCG is given when follicle is of a good size and is used to rupture the follicle and cause ovulation. This treatment has already worked since you have ovulated according to your ultrasound.3) Naturogest is for providing additional progesterone support to the foetus.So, in my opinion, you have been given the perfect treatment. There are high chances of pregnancy if there are no other causes of infertility like tubal block, uterine anomalies or male factor.I hope this was helpful.Regards,Dr. Shikha Shah",

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?"

    "reference_response": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Avoid smoking and other addictions. 2. Reduce salt intake in the diet. 3. Reduce fatty foods, junk foods, saturated fats (Mediterranean diet is the best). 4. Avoid stress and anxiety. 5. Do regular moderate intensity exercise such as brisk walk for 30 minutes. 6. Have proper night sleep, atleast 8 hours per 24 hours including atleast 6 hours in night uninterrupted sleep. 7. Reduce weight even if weight is within the normal range. 8. Drink plenty of water. 9. Do deep breathing exercises and meditation. Measure BP while you are totally relaxed, sit for five minutes in a quiet room without talking to anyone. Empty bowel and bladder before checking BP. Avoid tea/coffee 30 minutes before checking BP. Sit on a chair with feet on the ground, back supported, hand supported on table, cuff at the position of heart. Check BP, and repeat after five minutes again. Then check BP in other arm and repeat after five minutes. During the entire period remain relax and quiet. Arm with higher BP readings is your BP. You may take atleast two or more readings and average of readings is your actual BP. What dose you were taking of Amlodipine and Olmesartan when your bp was 150/90? What medicine was changed?

Headache: if it can be controlled with overthecounter painkillers for less than two times a week, it could be lack of sleep or some stress. Sore throat and lymph nodes: If they are less than 1 cm in diameter, hurt when you move them and are not growing, you could have had a viral infection. Another important thing here is to know if you have been having fever, night sweats or lost some weight. If you have one of these we might need some laboratory tests. Lower back pain: the most common cause of this is having a bad posture while working or studying. Another cause might be you lifted a heavy object or made an abnormal or quick move involving your back. For this you can take an analgesic with a muscle relaxant (for example Methocarbamol with Ibuprofen) three times a day for five days in a row. Weak feet: How long does this last in the morning? Seconds, minutes, hours? This may be caused by a lesion in you back. Let's see if it gets better with the treatment for back pain I just told you about. Fever, weight loss or night sweats? Infectious, allergic. Metocabamol 500 mg, Ibuprofen 400 mg, three times a day for five days. Observate lymph nodes since they should get smaller in less than a month. If symptoms continue or get worse we need to take a look at those nodes and the weakness on legs in order to decide if you need laboratory tests.",

First, I suppose your doctor also informed you that lisinopril does not exert such effect like lowering the heart rate, thus reducing the palpitations. Also, lisinopril and other ''prils'' can cause dry cough as a side effect. I am assuming you had high blood pressure and that is why your doctor prescribed lisinopril. In this point that we are standing, I would recommend you to do an EKG, to clear what these palpitations are; an echocardiogram to re-evaluate your mitral valve prolapse and if it is causing mitral regurgitation (returning of the blood through the mitral valve during systole, when it is normally shut) and, if so, what grade is it and does it correlate with symptoms; also, a 24-hour Holter rhythm registration, to see how often the palpitations do happen during a day. It is only when these tests are performed, you can discuss treatment strategies with your curing doctor. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Feel free to contact me again.
